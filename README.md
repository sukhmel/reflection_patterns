reflection_patterns
===================

Graphical representation of patterns emerging when a line of changing colors is reflected many times inside of a 2D box. Inspired by patterns demonstrated here http://xcont.com/about.html and here http://habrahabr.ru/post/194406/

The idea is that a straight line is drawn in different (two by default: background and foreground) colors at an angle of 45 degree inside of rectangular field. When the line hits a border it is reflected at the same angle. After the moment when line hits corner it stops.
The contiguous arrays of points left by said line may be coloured to reveal pretty patterns.

In countrary to patterns created in works linked above, line can be set up to be of any sequence of colors.
